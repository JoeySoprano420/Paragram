# Paragram

I. PHILOSOPHY OF PARAGRAM
Paragram is the language where symbolism is minimal, yet meaning is maximal. Every character, token, or directive carries significant weight. The language is designed for precision, predictive execution, panoptic logic, and linear-free control flow. It is structurally flat, symbol-light, opcode-aware, and execution-agnostic.

No indentation. No formatting rules. No fluff. Just powerful logic in its purest expressive shell.
